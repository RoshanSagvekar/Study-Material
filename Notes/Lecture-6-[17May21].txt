    Looping statement :- 
        looping statement are used in python to execute the 
        the of statement repeately.
        
        Each repetition is known as iteration
        It is know as iteration statements
        
        There are 2 type of loop in python.
        1. for loop
            when we known the number of iteration we use for loop,
            or when we want to perform some operation on sequence like 
            str, list, tuple,set dictionary, 
        2. while 
            we we don't known the number of iteration  then
            while is good to the program.
1. For loop :-
    for is used to for iterating sequence of python like list tuple etc.
    syntax:-
        for itr_variable in sequence:
        <-tab-> statements to be execute til sequence is not completed. 

        s1 = 'ITVedant'
        print("\nstr Iteration")
        for letter in s1:
            print(letter,end=', ') 

        l1 = [1,6,'Raj',[12,36],'Jay',21]
        print("\nList Iteration")
        for element in l1:
            print(element,end=', ')
