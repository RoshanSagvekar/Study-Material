3.Logical Operator
    Logical operator used to write 2 or more condition in one single if statements.

    i)AND operator
        returns true if and only if al the condition is true.

        E.g
            n1=2 and n2=5

            n1>1 and n2<7   -->True
            n1>1 and n2>7   -->False
            n1<1 and n2<7   -->False
            n1<1 and n2>7   -->False

        ii)OR operator
            returns true if one of the condition is true,if all condition are
            false then it will be false.

        E.g
            n1=2 and n2=5

            n1>1 and n2<7   -->True
            n1>1 and n2>7   -->True
            n1<1 and n2<7   -->True
            n1<1 and n2>7   -->False

        iii)Not Operator
                It will reverse the result.
                if result is true false become true and vice versa.

4. Membership Operator:-
    These operator used with sequencial object(iterable object)
    like list ,tuple,set,dictionary.

    i)in Operator:-
        check if value is exist in given sequence

    ii)Not in
        check if the value is not exist in given sequence.

5.Identical Operator

    i)is:-
        returns true if memory address of 2 variable is same or not.

    ii)is not:-
        returns true if memory address of 2 variable is different or not.

-5 to 256 the range of the values are resereved into memeory.

6.Bitwise Operator
    Bitwise Operator:-

&    bitwise And  return 1 bit if both are 1 otherwise 0 
|    bitwise or   return 1 bit if one of two bits is 1
^    bitwise E-or return 1 bit if one of the bits is 0 and 
                  the other bit is 1. if both bits 0 or 1 then 
                  returns 0.

<<   left shift
                left shift operator shifts the bits of left operand towards 
                left side for give number of time in right operand.
                eg
                    1010<<2  ---> 101000  
                    0011<<2  ---> 1100
                simple words, In binary number is append with 
                with 0s bit at end.

>>  right shift:-
                right shift operator is exactly opposite the left shift,
                left side operand bits are shifted to the right side
                for given number of time.

                e.g
                    1010 >> 2   --> 0010
                    0011 >> 2   --> 0000
                  simple words, In binary number right side bits 
                  removed from number.

~  one's complement:- 
                one's complement of any number is equivalent to negative
                number of it plus.

                It will add one more bit in binary number and change its 
                sign.
                
                i.e 
                    The one's complement of n is equal -(n+1) 
                e.g
                    10 --> 1010
                    ~10 == -(1010+1)
                        == -(1011)  --> 11
