#Conditional Operator
    These operators are used to create a condition on python program.
    All the operator returns value in bool type i.e true or False.

        1. == equal to
            returns True if left and right values are equal.

        2. != not equal
            returns True if left and rigth values are not equal.

        3.  >  greater than
            returns true if left value is greater than right side value otherwise false.

        4.  < less than 
            returns true if left value is less than right side value otherwise false.

        5.  >= greater than or equal to
            returns true if left side value is greater or equal to right side value.

        6.  <=less than or equal to
            returns true if left side value is less than or equal to right side value.
    
To use above Operator in program we use condition statement

    1.if statement
        syntax:-
            if condition:
                statement to be executed if condition is true.
                otherwise skip this block.
        E.g:-
        #WAP to accept a number from user and print it if it is positive?
        num=int(input('Enter a Number='))
            if num>0:
                print('Entered Number is',num)
            print('Program Execution is completed')

    2.if...else statement(work with 2 possibilities)
        -else never contains condition.
        -else never write without if.
        syntax:
            if condition:
                statement to be executed if condition is True.
            else:
                statement to be executed if condition is False.

        e.g:WAP to accept a number from user and print it if it is odd or even?
        num=int(input('Enter a Number='))
            if num%2==0:
                print('Entered Number is Even. \nnum:-',num)
            else:
                print('Entered number is Odd. \nnum:-',num)
        print('Program execution is completed.')

    3.if....elif...else(more than 2 possibilities in program)
      it is also known as Ladder if else statement.
      syntax:
            if condition1:
                statement to be executed if condition is true.

            elseif condition2:
                statement to be executed if condition1 is false and 
                condition2 is True.
            .
            .
            .
            else:
                statement to be executed if all conditions are false.

        E.g:-#WAP to check entered number is Zero or Negative or Positive
            num=int(input('Enter a Number='))

            if num>0:
                print('Entered Number is Positive. \nnum:-',num)
            elif num<0:
                print('Entered number is Negative. \nnum:-',num)
            else:
                print('Entered number is Zero')
        print('Program execution is completed.')


    4.Nested if else
        one if statement or else statement have one or more
        if or else statement.

        Syntax:
            if Outercondition:
                if innerCondition:
                    statement it will executed if both are true.
                else:
                    statement it wil executed if outer is true and inner is false.
            else:
                statement to be executed.
