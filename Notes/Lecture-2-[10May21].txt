WHAT IS VARIABLE ?
	-variable is a name of memory location where the values is stored in RAM memory.
	-variable name must start with letters after letters we can use digit.
	-variable name are also case sensitive.

	-It can be change also in runtime.
	-Thats why python dynamically type programming

	e.g:
		a=34
		print('a:-',a)
		print('type of a',type(a))
		b=3.3 
		print('b:-',b)
		print('type of b',type(b))
		c='Roshan'      
		print('c:-',c)
		print('type of c',type(c))

WHAT IS DATATYPE?
	-Datatype is nothing but what type of value we store into the value
	-Python has following types of datatype.

	->Numeric:-
		int->	Non-decimal number will be store.
		float ->	decimal number will be store.

	->Sequence:-
		str(sequence of character (string))
		list(sequence of any type of value)
		tuple(sequence of any fixed number of value)
		set(sequence of any type value in random order)
		dictionary(sequence of pair(key-value))
			e.g Phone Dictionary
			client name with there number
			here number are key and name are value.s
